# Authentication System Updates

## Overview

The authentication system has been completely overhauled to fix a critical issue where users could log in even when the backend was unavailable. All mock authentication functionality has been removed to ensure proper security.

## Key Changes

1. **Removed All Mock Authentication**

   - All mock authentication functionality has been removed from the codebase
   - Users can only authenticate through the actual backend API

2. **Strict Backend Validation**

   - Token validation strictly requires the backend to be available
   - User sessions are invalidated if backend validation fails
   - Login page displays clear errors when the backend is unavailable

3. **Enhanced Token Security**

   - Removed all automatic token regeneration functionality
   - Any stored credentials without valid tokens require re-authentication

4. **Simplified Environment Configuration**
   - Removed configurable authentication settings
   - Backend validation is always required and cannot be disabled
   - Separate development and production API endpoints

## Environment Variables

| Variable            | Purpose              | Default                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL | Backend API endpoint | http://localhost:4008 (dev) |

> **Note:** Backend validation is always required, regardless of environment.

## Backend Requirements

- The backend must be running at http://localhost:4008 for development
- The backend should provide a `/health` endpoint for availability checks
- The backend should provide an `/auth/profile` endpoint for token validation

## Testing the Authentication System

1. Start the backend server at http://localhost:4008
2. Start the Next.js application
3. Try logging in with valid credentials - should work normally
4. Stop the backend server and try logging in again - should see a clear error message
5. While logged in, stop the backend server and navigate to protected routes - should be logged out

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Ensure the backend server is running at http://localhost:4008
2. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
3. Clear browser cookies and localStorage if authentication state becomes corrupted
4. Verify that the backend has proper CORS configuration to accept requests from the frontend
